This course is at the intersection of Formal Methods, Control Theory, Robotics, and Machine Learning. This course is divided into 3 parts.

1) Introductory lectures on Formal Methods, Control, Robotics, and Machine Learning.
2) Paper reading, discussion, student presentations, and critique.
3) Project discussion and presentations.

The primary learning objective in this course is to introduce students to the ongoing research in the domain of autonomy with a specific focus on safety analysis. This would require understanding the following tools and techniques.

1. Tools and techniques for modeling and verification of systems specifications in a rigorous manner.
2. Foundations of Control and application of optimization techniques in Control.
3. Learning based techniques and their applications in Robotics and Control.
4. Ongoing research on rigorous analysis of Learning and Control.

* Course Requirements

Course attendance is required and is essential as the main focus of this course is to discuss papers. Studentsare expected to follow the UNC honor code: [[http://honor.unc.edu/][http://honor.unc.edu/]]. Active class participation is encouraged.

** Prerequisits
There are no explicit prerequisits for the course. It would be beneficial to have knowledge of mathematical foundations such as differential equations, linear algebra, probability, mathematical logic, and theory of computation. The instructor will give a basic primer and several references for background reading if the student feels that they need to read more on the background of a specific topic. The goal of this course is the expose the students to the ongoing research in the domain of autonomous systems with a focus of safety. While it is not expected that you understand every single detail of all the papers, you are expected to make the best effort to learn and actively contribute to the class.

** Academic Honesty
Refer to UNCâ€™shonor code at http://instrument.unc.edu/ for a discussion on Academic Honesty. If you are in doubt about any aspect of the honor code, please ask. Collaboration on assignments is encouraged. However, what you hand in must be your own solution with your own writing/typing/source code. Turning in virtually identical work is not acceptable. Good scholarship requires that all collaboration must beacknowledged. Thus, if you collaborate on the solution of a problem set, you have to list your collaborators at the top of the page. Collaboration on quizzes or exams (if applicable) is not permitted and a violation of the Honor Code, see http://www.cs.unc.edu/Admin/Courses/HonorCode.html. If you consult any outside sources when doing your work, you are expected to fully document those sources. Give credit where creditis due. Plagiarism will not be tolerated.

* Topics

Given the vast breadth of the course, the topics will be covered in an introductory manner. We will get deeper into each of these topics as we go through the papers.

 + Mathematical Logic
 + First Order Logic and Temporal Logic
 + SAT/SMT and Model Checking
 + Foundations of Control
 + Linear vs Nonlinear Control
 + Important techniques in Controls.
   - Lyapunov based Control.
   - Model Predictive Control.
   - Optimal Control.
 + Hybrid systems.
 + Verification techniques for control systems.
 + Path planning.
 + Neural Networks as function Approximators.
 + Verification of Neural Networks.
